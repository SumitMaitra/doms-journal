• How international will the journal be and how will this be reflected in the editorial 
objectives? For example, how will  you ensure that you receive contributions from 
other countries of the world? 
 
Answer – NITI: Journal of Management Research  aims to establish itself as an international 
platform for advancing research in management, governance, and public policy. Its 
international character will be reflected through a globally represented editorial and advisory 
board, featuring scholars from Asia, Europe, and North America. The journal’s editorial 
objectives emphasize attracting contributions that explore cross -national perspectives, 
comparative policy frameworks, and management practices across emerging and developed 
economies. To ensure a steady flow of global submissions, NITI will issue international calls 
for papers , collaborate with foreign universities and research institutions , and pursue 
inclusion in leading indexing databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest. A 
diverse reviewer panel  will further ensure that the journal upholds its commitment to 
international scholarship and cross-cultural dialogue in management research. 
 
• What intentions, if any, do you have regarding foreign-language contributions? We 
would encourage you, for a range of practical reasons, to consider certainly initially, 
limiting contributions to the English language. If you wish to translate articles, you 
need to consider a) who would undertake translation and b) how will decisions be 
reached on articles in languages not known by the Editors? 
 
Answer - Initially, NITI: Journal of Management Research will accept and publish manuscripts 
exclusively in English  to ensure uniformity, accessibility, and ease of international 
dissemination. This aligns with global academic publishing standards and the capabilities of 
the editorial and review teams. As the journal matures, it may consider publishing translated 
versions of select high -impact articles originally published in other languages that have 
significant scholarly relevance to management and policy research in emerging economies. In 
such cases, translation will be handled by professional translators or qualifie d bilingual 
subject experts approved by the editorial board. 
The journal's rationale (why the journal is needed) 
Rationale for the journal 
• Why is the journal needed? 
 
Ans - The proposed journal is needed to provide a dedicated platform for high-quality, policy-
relevant research in management studies and allied disciplines that addresses both theoretical 
advancements and practical applications. While numerous management journals exist, few 
focus on contemporary challenges, innovations, and emerging practices in India and the 
broader Asian context. This journal will fill that gap by publishing research that is academically 
rigorous and directly applicable to policymaking and organizational decision-making. 
 
• What is the background to the proposal in terms of the current and future 
development of the field? 
 
Ans - Management studies are rapidly evolving due to technological disruption, globalization, 
and dynamic organizational practices. In India, growth in entrepreneurial ventures, digital 
adoption, and innovation -driven business models is transforming the bu siness landscape. 
Despite these developments, scholarly literature that reflects regional realities and emerging 
trends is limited. The journal aims to address this by providing a forum for research on topics 
such as digital transformation, innovation mana gement, sustainable business practices, and 
leadership in complex organizational environments, integrating global management theory 
with local insights. 
 
• How confident are you of not only finding an audience for the journal, but also of 
generating sufficient high-quality contributions? 
 
Ans - We expect that the journal will attract a diverse and engaged readership, along with a 
steady flow of high -quality contributions. By reaching out to established scholars, emerging 
researchers, and experienced practitioners globally, and through thema tic issues and industry 
collaborations, the journal aims to foster rigorous, impactful research while building a 
meaningful community of readers and contributors. 
• How will this journal be unique to the specialty, what need does the journal fulfil? 
Describe why this journal is needed now.  
 
Ans - The journal will be distinctive in its focus on bridging global management theory with 
emerging market contexts, particularly India. It will support interdisciplinary research, 
integrating insights from technology, policy, and organizational studies,  while facilitating 
knowledge exchange between academia and industry. Given the rapid evolution of India’s 
business landscape and increasing global interest in emerging market management practices, 
this journal addresses a timely and critical need for cont extually relevant, high -quality 
research, enhancing NIT Durgapur’s leadership in management studies and contributing 
meaningfully to global academic discourse. 
The envisaged editorial structure 
Who would be the journal's editors?

• List major competing journals, their publishers, audience, and relative strengths 
and weaknesses of each. 
 
Ans -  
1) IIM Kozhikode Society & Management Review (IKSMR) 
• Publisher: SAGE, in association with IIM Kozhikode.  
• Audience: Management scholars and a multidisciplinary practitioner readership. 
• Strengths: India focus; bridge between society and management; reputable IIM 
backing.  
• Weaknesses: Biannual cadence limits volume; narrower global visibility than top-
tier US/UK titles.  
2) Vikalpa: The Journal for Decision Makers 
• Publisher: IIM Ahmedabad with SAGE (hosted on SAGE platform).  
• Audience: Decision-makers, managers, management academics in India and 
abroad.  
• Strengths: Practitioner orientation; long history since 1976; open access expands 
reach.  
• Weaknesses: India-centric positioning; perceived as applied vs. theory -heavy 
outlets.  
3) Arthaniti: Journal of Economic Theory & Practice 
• Publisher: SAGE in collaboration with University of Calcutta.  
• Audience: Economists and policy researchers across theory and applied domains.  
• Strengths: Economics breadth across theory/empirics; legacy title rejuvenated 
with SAGE partnership.  
• Weaknesses: Economics-first scope limits management readership; biannual 
frequency.  
4) Journal of Strategy and Management (JSMA) 
• Publisher: Emerald Publishing.  
• Audience: Strategy researchers and executives in public and private sectors.  
• Strengths: Explicit research–executive bridge; global strategy development and 
implementation focus.  
• Weaknesses: Strategy emphasis over policy analysis; mid -tier influence versus

6) Journal of Economics & Management Strategy (JEMS) 
• Publisher: Wiley.  
• Audience: IO economists, strategy scholars using theory and empirics.  
• Strengths: Strong IO/game -theory grounding; rigorous strategy –economics 
interface.  
• Weaknesses: Methods skew to econ/IO may deter practice-oriented policy work; 
less focus on emerging-economy governance.  
 
• How will the journal relate to relevant existing journals in the world and what 
will your journal offer that these do not? 
 
Ans - NITI: Journal of Management Research  will complement existing journals by 
focusing on the policy–strategy–management interface in emerging economies , a 
space few address fully. 
Most global journals emphasize either strategy (e.g., Strategic Management Journal , 
Global Strategy Journal) or policy/governance (e.g., JPAM, PAR), usually in developed 
contexts. Indian journals like IIM Kozhikode Society & Management Review , Vikalpa, 
and Arthaniti are valuable but remain discipline-specific and nationally focused. 
NITI will stand out by: 
• Integrating policy, management, and governance in one platform. 
• Centering emerging economies rather than treating them as peripheral cases. 
• Encouraging pluralistic methodologies across disciplines. 
• Bridging academia and practice , engaging policymakers, managers, and 
scholars. 
• Amplifying Global South perspectives , filling a clear geographic and thematic 
gap. 
This positioning differentiates NITI clearly while complementing existing global titles. 
 
 
• If no comparable journals exist, why? 
 
Ans - Comparable journals do exist 
 
 
• How does the proposed journal fit into the SAGE journals program? 
 
Ans - NITI: Journal of Management Research fits strategically within the SAGE journals 
program by expanding its global, interdisciplinary, and policy-focused portfolio. 
SAGE already publishes strong titles in management (e.g., Journal of Management), 
governance, and social sciences, but few journals integrate policy, strategy, and 
management with a focus on emerging economies. NITI fills this gap by: 
• Aligning with SAGE’s global strategy to grow research from the Global South and 
diversify perspectives. 
• Complementing existing management and policy journals through an 
interdisciplinary focus. 
• Expanding SAGE’s reach to policymakers, business leaders, and academics in 
emerging markets. 
• Offering portfolio differentiation with its emphasis on cross-sectoral insights and 
practical policy impact. 
• Supporting SAGE’s mission of advancing impactful, globally relevant research. 
This positioning strengthens SAGE’s presence in management and policy research while 
opening new geographic and thematic frontiers
